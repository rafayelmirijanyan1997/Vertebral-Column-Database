Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Vertebral_Column_dataset_analysis.ipynb) that performs an analysis on the Vertebral Column dataset. The dataset is fetched from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes biomechanical features used to classify orthopaedic patients into different categories (normal, disk hernia, or spondylolisthesis). The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Vertebral Column dataset, which can be accessed via the UCI Machine Learning Repository (ID: 212). It contains six biomechanical features derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine. The target variable is the classification of patients into three categories: Normal, Disk Hernia, or Spondylolisthesis.

Features:
Pelvic Incidence

Pelvic Tilt

Lumbar Lordosis Angle

Sacral Slope

Pelvic Radius

Degree of Spondylolisthesis

Target:
Class (Normal, Hernia, Spondylolisthesis)

Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

ucimlrepo: To fetch the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

numpy: For numerical operations.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For data visualization.

seaborn: For advanced data visualization.

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install ucimlrepo numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Notebook Structure
Data Downloading and Loading:

The dataset is fetched using the ucimlrepo library.

Basic information about the dataset is displayed, including feature descriptions and metadata.

Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The dataset is preprocessed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Scatterplots and other visualizations are created to explore the relationships between independent variables and the target classes.

Machine Learning Model Application:

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is applied to the dataset.

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

Results and Visualizations:

The results of the classification are visualized using confusion matrices and other relevant plots.

Insights from the analysis are discussed.
